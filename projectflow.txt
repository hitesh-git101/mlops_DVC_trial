Create git repo and clone it in local.
Create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
#pip instal dvc If you have not done it before.
now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory), just to replicate the aws service workflow.
Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3", in place of S3 we will be adding AWS S3 bucket url if we were accessing it remotely from AWS cloud
Next "dvc add data/" # dvc is responsible for all the changes in the data that will happen going forward, we are already expecting an error
 Now it will ask to do : ("git rm -r --cached 'data' " and "git commit -m "stop tracking data" ")
 Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle
Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
